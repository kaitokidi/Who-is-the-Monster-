# Who-is-the-Monster- Ludum Dare 33

funny game to play while you are on a social meeting, a party or anywhere with friends

Who is the Monster is a social game made by Gen√≠s Bayona, with help of Cristina Raluca Vijulie, and graphics made by Xevi Bayona but another the good kind of social games which means party, laughts and happiness.

RULES:

There is a monster between us, and we must hunt it 

In order to capture the monster we will use the following procedure:

- If you want to ask something to someone, 
you can say his/her name on the question. (i.e. "How are you John?","Joan, how old are you?","Would you like a refill Marta?")

- If you have said the name, he/she has to answer saying that he/she is not the monster. 
(i.e "Very good, because i'm not the monster","I'm 22 years old, and as you can realize, monsters don't live so much so i'm not one",
"Monsters hate beer, and i'm not one, so give me a refill").

- If someone claims not to be the monster without being asked any question with his/her name, it will be obvious that 
he/she is a monster and has screwed up pretending that he/she is not.

- If someone answer a question that has been made using 
his/her name and does not say that he/she is not the monster,
Someone who realise it can say (or yell)

" You are the monster! "

(In order to make sure the answer is over, you will have to wait at least 3 seconds between the answer and the acusation)
If someone is acused of being a monster, he/she will have to pass a test to demonstrate his/her innoscense.

The test will be chosen by this game using a sofisticated method of randomly picked "truth or dare" actions, 
but you can play it even without this game using your own tests.

Be respectfull, remember that the monster is only a joke, we all are humans, enjoy it, and have fun!
Hope you might like it!
